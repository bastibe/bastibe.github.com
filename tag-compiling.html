<p>
If you want to use rlua, you need to have Lua installed. However, OSX does not come with Lua preinstalled, so you install it using
</p>

<p>
#+begin src sh
    brew install lua
#end<sub>src</sub>
</p>

<p>
Oh, would it be nice if everyone agreed on how to install stuff like this. Case in point, homebrew installs liblua (quite reasonable) in <code>/usr/local/lib/liblua.[5.1[.4]].dylib</code>
</p>

<p>
rlua however expects it to be called <code>liblua5.1.dylib</code> (notice the missing <code>.</code>).
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the headers are installed plainly into <code>/usr/local/include</code>, whereas rlua expects them to be in a folder called <code>lua5.1</code>.
</p>

<p>
Hence, here is how you get rlua to install:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">    ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/lua/5.1.4/lib/liblua.5.1.4.dylib /usr/local/lib/liblua5.1.dylib
    ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/lua/5.1.4/include/ /usr/local/include/lua5.1
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Not exactly a beautiful solution, but it works.

<p>
Well, it's compile time again. Once again, I need to install scipy and matplotlib using homebrew and pip on Lion.
It seems things have improved since I tried to compile last time! Well, it still does not work out of the box, but at least now it can be done without compiling by hand:
(remember to <code>brew install pkg-config gfortran</code> first)
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">pip install -e git+https://github.com/scipy/scipy#<span style="color: #111111;">egg</span>=scipy-dev
pip install -e git+https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib#<span style="color: #111111;">egg</span>=matplotlib
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I must say, this is still a mess. But at least, it is getting less bad.
</p>
<div class="taglist"><a href="tags.html">Tags:</a> <a href="tag-compiling.html">compiling</a> <a href="tag-python.html">python</a> </div>
<div class="post-date">01 Aug 2011</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2011-08-01-compiling-scipy-and-matplotlib-using-pip-on-lion.html">Compiling Scipy and Matplotlib using pip on Lion</a></h1>
<p>
So I upgraded to Lion. Predictably, some things went wrong. This time, the main thing that bit me was that for some reason, <code>pip</code> stopped working. After a bit of messing around with <code>brew</code>, <code>pip</code> and <code>easy_install</code>, I found out it was almost entirely my own fault. I messed up my <code>PATH</code>.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I had uninstalled all of <code>brew</code>'s Python, so I had to reinstall. For me, that entails Python, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. Only this time, Scipy would not build. Some obscure error in some <code>veclib_cabi_c.c</code> would report errors. A quick <a href="http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/scipy-user/2009-June/021383.html">round of googling</a> reveals:
</p>

<p>
In order to get Scipy to compile, you need to insert <code>#include &lt;complex.h&gt;</code> in
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">    ./scipy/lib/blas/fblaswrap_veclib_c.c.src
    ./scipy/linalg/src/fblaswrap_veclib_c.c
    ./scipy/sparse/linalg/eigen/arpack/ARPACK/FWRAPPERS/veclib_cabi_c.c
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That done, Scipy compiles perfectly fine.
</p>

<p>
But, that is not enough yet. As <a href="http://jholewinski.wordpress.com/2011/07/21/installing-matplotlib-on-os-x-10-7-with-homebrew/">this blogpost</a> outlines, Matplotlib is not currently compatible with <code>libpng</code> 1.5, which ships with Lion. Fortunately, this is already fixed in the most recent source on the Matplotlib repo, so you just have to checkout that:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">    pip install -e git+https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git#<span style="color: #111111;">egg</span>=matplotlib
</pre>
</div>

<p>
By doing that, Matplotlib should install just fine.
</p>

<p>
Seriously though, these PyPi repos are in a very sorry state. Every time I install one of these packages, I have to jump through hoops and spend hours debugging packages that really should work right out of the box. After all, <code>brew</code>, <code>rvm</code> and <code>gem</code> can do it just fine. Why is <code>pip</code> such a horrible mess?
</p>

<p>
So I want to do audio development on the Mac without using Matlab. An alternative to Matlab is Python, or rather, <a href="http://www.daskrachen.com/2011/02/installing-pythonnumpyscipymatplotlib.html">Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib</a>. They are awesome for working with audio data. What they don't do however is playing back audio. There are several packages out there that would afford audio playback. If you are serious about this though, you not only want audio playback, you want asynchronous audio playback. That is, you want to send some audio data to the sound card and continue with your program without waiting for the audio to finish playing. This allows continuous audio playback of computer-generated sound.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">Pygame</a> is one package that allows this. (I will submit a patch to <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/">Pyaudio</a> soon that will enable it there, too). There are pre-built binaries on the Pygame website that you can install easily. But then there would be no easy way to uninstall them, so what I would rather want is to install Pygame using package managers that allow easy updating and uninstallation. My tool of choice on the Mac is of course <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that although I am mostly interested in audio playback, this post will detail the installation of all modules of Pygame, not just <code>pygame.mixer</code>.
</p>

<p>
Homebrew won't install Pygame, but it will install all the prerequisites for Pygame. So, let's do that.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">brew install sdl, sdl_mixer, sdl_ttf, libpng, jpeg, sdl_image, portmidi
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This will install most packages for you. Note that <code>libpng</code> is also available as a system library, so it is installed <code>keg_only</code>, that is, without linking it in your path. We will need to compile against it though, so the next step is
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">brew link libpng
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now there is still one package missing, <code>smpeg</code>. Sadly, <code>smpeg</code> does not install its headers, so you can't compile against it. To fix that, type
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">brew edit smpeg
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and add the following line just above the two end at the end of the file
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">include.install Dir[<span style="color: #303030;">"*.h"</span>]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then save the file. (I submitted a bug to have this fixed, so you might not need to do this when you read this). Now you can install <code>smpeg</code> with the usual
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">brew install smpeg
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and you will get the headers, too. Isn't Homebrew great?
</p>

<p>
Now that all the prerequisites are met, lets look at Pygame itself. This is rather more difficult, as it will not build properly against Homebrew libraries on its own. First, download the source package of Pygame from the [official website](<a href="http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml">http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml</a>). Unpack it to some directory.
</p>

<p>
Now open a terminal and navigate to that directory. Me, I like [iTerm](<a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">http://iterm.sourceforge.net/</a>), but Terminal.app will do just fine, too. In there, run <code>python config.py</code> to create an initial setup file.
</p>

<p>
At this point, the setup file is mostly useless since <code>config.py</code> failed to find any homebrew-installed library. It is also strangely garbled, so there is some manual labor to do. Open the file <code>Setup</code> (no extension) in your favourite text editor. After the first comment block, you will see a line that looks like this
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">SDL = -I/NEED_INC_PATH_FIX -L/NEED_LIB_PATH_FIX -lSDL
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Obviously, this is lacking the paths to the SDL library. If you installed Homebrew to its default directory, this will be in <code>/usr/local…</code>. Hence, change this line to
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">SDL = -I/usr/local/include/SDL -L/usr/local/lib -lSDL
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The next lines are strangely garbled. They say, for example
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">FONT = -lS -lD -lL -l_ -lt -lt -lf
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Where they actually should say
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">FONT = -lSDL_ttf
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Instead of having one <code>-l</code> and then the library name <code>SDL_ttf</code>, they put <code>-l</code> in front of every single letter of the name. This is strange, and certainly wrong. So, correct it for <code>FONT</code>, <code>IMAGE</code>, <code>MIXER</code> and <code>SMPEG</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that I did not tell you to do this for <code>PORTTIME</code>, too. Actually, <code>PORTTIME</code> is already correctly linked in <code>PORTMIDI</code>, so you don't need that at all any more. Just delete or comment the <code>PORTTIME</code> line.
</p>

<p>
Now that all the dependencies are corrected, lets enable the features. A few lines further down, there will be a block of lines, where most lines begin with a <code>#</code> except for the ones beginning with <code>_numericsurfarray…</code> and <code>_camera…</code>, These are the different features of Pygame: The ones with the <code>#</code> are disabled, the other two are enabled.
</p>

<p>
With all the stuff we installed earlier, you can now enable all features (remove the <code>#</code> in front of <code>imageext…</code>, <code>font…</code>, <code>mixer…</code>, <code>mixer_music…</code>, <code>_minericsndarray…</code>, <code>movie…</code>, <code>scrap…</code> and <code>pypm…</code>).
</p>

<p>
Remember we disabled <code>PORTTIME</code> a while ago? Right, so we have to remove that dependency: In the line starting with <code>pypm…</code>, delete the part that says <code>$(PORTTIME)</code>. Great. That was easy, right? Now save that file and go back to the Terminal.
</p>

<p>
We are now going to compile and install Pygame. The nice thing is, even though we are installing it manually, it will go in the right directories and it will be registered with <code>pip</code> or <code>easy_install</code>, so you can just invoke them if you want to uninstall it later by typing <code>pip uninstall pygame</code>. This is something I love about Python!
</p>

<p>
Alright, now without further ado, install Pygame by typing
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">python setup.py install
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Great! That's it! Everything should work now!

<div class="post-date">03 Feb 2011</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="2011-02-03-installing-python-slash-numpy-slash-scipy-slash-matplotlib-on-osx.html">Installing Python/Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib on OSX</a></h1>
<p>
For numerical analysis and signal processing prototyping, you would use <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>. However, Matlab has some downsides that might make it unsuitable for your project. It might be too expensive. You might be a snobbish programmer that can't stand less-than-elegant programming languages. I certainly am.
</p>

<p>
So, you look for alternatives. You could take <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a>, which is free, but that would not solve that ugly-code issue. You could take any scripting language you fancy, but Ruby, Perl and Python are too slow to do serious number crunching.
</p>

<p>
Then, you stumble upon that Python package called <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">Numpy</a>, which seems to be nearly as fast as Matlab when it comes to matrix processing and linear algebra. You then discover <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, which would add all that signal processing prowess of Matlab (do quick transformations, random numbers, statistics) to your toolbox. Last but not least, you need plotting. That would be <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib</a> then, which provides quick plotting facilities in Python.
</p>

<p>
And the best thing is, these three systems work really well together. They seem to be the perfect replacement for Matlab that could even be superiour to it in many regards.
</p>

<p>
Next up, you need to install all that stuff. If you are like me, you naturally want to do all that on a Mac. Also, you kind of dislike all these installer-thingies, which install stuff to unknown places and are nigh impossible to uninstall or update cleanly. Even though, you could of course just go to the individual websites, download Python, Numpy, SciPy and Matplotlib, run them installers, and be done. You would save yourself a lot of trouble that way.
</p>

<p>
But since you allegedly are like me, you instead fire up <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew"><code>brew</code></a> and try to install all that stuff using that. Again, you could use <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> or <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a> instead, but you probably had some bad experiences with them and you generally love the hackishness of Homebrew, so this is your natural first try.
</p>

<p>
So you set about this, you believe in packet managers and trust them to take care of every obstacle that might be lying in your way. First of all, install the latest developer tools from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">developer.apple.com</a>. You might need to register (for free) to get them. Also, you need to install <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew">Homebrew</a>.
</p>

<p>
To cut this short, here is what you need to get that Python running:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">    brew install python
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This one should be obvious. At the time of writing, it will install Python 2.7.1. You could take Python 3, but matplotlib is not compatible to it, so you kind of have to stick with 2.7.1 instead.
</p>

<p>
You also need to put <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and <code>/usr/local/sbin</code> in the beginning of your path to make sure the new Python gets loaded instead of the pre-installed one. You do that by writing
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">    <span style="color: #111111;">export</span> <span style="color: #111111;">PATH</span>=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$<span style="color: #111111;">PATH</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
in your <code>\~/.bash_profile</code>. (Create it if its not there&#x2013;it is just a simple text file).
</p>

<p>
Now, if you type <code>python --version</code>, you should get <code>Python 2.7.1</code> as a response.
</p>

<p>
Alright, next up, install the python package manager:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">    brew install distribute
    brew install pip
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This will come preconfigured for your newly installed Python. In an ideal world, this should be all. The world being as it is, the pip package of Matplotlib is severely broken and has one other unstated dependency:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">    brew install pkg-config
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Also, SciPy is using some FORTRAN sources, so you need a fortran compiler:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">    brew install gfortran
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Alright. That was enough. Now on to pip. With all these dependencies cleared, pip should be able to download Numpy and Scipy without trouble:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">    pip install numpy
    pip install scipy
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Matplotlib, on the other hand, is more difficult to install. You see, pip is looking at the Python package repository <a href="http://pypi.python.org/">PyPi</a> for each package. PyPi then provides a URL. Pip then scans that website for links to suitable package files. But, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a> changed its links a while ago, so pip gets confused and will download an outdated version. Sourceforge says, its new links are way better and no way we will change them back; Pip says, well, if Sourceforge can't provide proper links, that's not our problem. Oh My. Silly children.
</p>

<p>
So we have to do this manually:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">    pip install -f http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.0.1/matplotlib-1.0.1.tar.gz matplotlib
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That URL comes straight from Sourceforge. Look for the latest version of Matplotlib, search for the download link to the source distribution (<code>*.tar.gz</code>), copy that link and strip any trailing '/download'.
</p>

<p>
UPDATE:
</p>

<p>
It seems the matplotlib package was updated in the meantime, so you can just run <code>pip install matplotlib</code> now.
</p>

<p>
This should now download and install matplotlib.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for reading.

<p>
So, jetzt habe ich mein Mex-File zum Einlesen beliebiger Audiodateien endlich lauffähig auf Windows und Mac. Leider werde ich nicht dafür bezahlt, auch noch eine Linux-Version zu bauen, aber falls Interesse besteht, versuche ich mich vielleicht einmal daran.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union">The State of The Union</a>: Kleine Dateien einlesen, kein Problem. Exotische Formate einlesen, kein Problem. Metadaten auslesen, kein Problem. Dateigröße, Bitrate und Samplerate auslesen, ein kleines Problem, da diese Parameter bei komprimierten Formaten nicht unbedingt fest stehen. Große Dateien einlösen, auf dem Mac kein Problem, auf Windows… nun ja, es dauert. Eine WAV-Datei von 5:30 min einzulesen, dauert mit Windows momentan ca. eine Stunde. Das kann nicht sein, in der Zeit habe ich die Datei dem Programm vorgelesen, wenn es sein muss.
</p>

<p>
Also, was ist da faul? Jetzt heißt es debuggen: <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger">GDB</a> ist mein Freund, aber leider spreche ich seine Sprache nicht, also Oldschool-Debugging mit <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/printf.html">printf()</a> (bzw. <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/apiref/mexprintf.html">mexPrintf()</a>; Aber da `#define printf mexPrintf` ist das das selbe). Blöd nur, dass Matlab selbst entscheidet, wann es meine Printfs auf den Bildschirm schreibt und es sich dazu entschlossen hat, dies immer erst nach dem Ausführen der Datei, also erst nachdem es bereits eine Stunde gearbeitet hat, zu tun. Einiges Hirnen später konnte ich Matlab endlich über eine Kombination aus <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typumwandlung">Typecasts</a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/sprintf.html">sprintf</a> und <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/apiref/mexwarnmsgtxt.html">mexWarnMsgTxt</a> dazu überreden, wenigstens sporadisch ein paar Informationen herauszugeben.
</p>

<p>
Das Ergebnis:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Die Datei funktioniert tadellos, ist nur ein wenig langsam (s.o.)</li>
<li>Wer ist schuld? <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdlib/realloc.html">Realloc</a> ist schuld!</li>
</ol>

<p>
Das kam überraschend! Offenbar ist realloc auf dem Mac um mehrere Größenordnungen performanter als auf <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>/Windows, denn die selbe Anwendung, die auf dem Mac ca. eine Sekunde braucht, braucht auf Windows eine Stunde! Und das allein wegen realloc! (Eigentlich: eine halbe Stunde wegen realloc, der Rest ist der Tatsache geschuldet, dass Windows in einer <a href="http://www.vmware.com/de/products/fusion/">VM</a> läuft)
</p>

<p>
Bei WAV-Dateien werden immer 2048 Samples an einem Stück ausgelesen. Danach verwende ich ein realloc, um meinen haupt-Speicherpuffer um diese Größe zu vergrößern und kopiere die neuen Daten dort hinein. Bei meinen 5:30 min macht das bei einer Samplerate von 44100 kHz und zwei Kanälen ca. 15000 Aufrufe von realloc. Komprimierte Datenformate haben üblicherweise kleinere Frames und damit noch einmal wesentlich mehr realloc-Aufrufe.
Der Plan ist also, jetzt statt häufiger, kleiner realloc-Aufrufe, seltenere, größere Aufrufe zu machen. Zeit für ein paar Experimente:

Das Spannende ist: Ich ändere durch meine Methodik praktisch nichts außer der Anzahl und Größe der realloc-Aufrufe, aber man erkennt einen eindeutigen Zusammenhang zwischen Performance und Anzahl der Aufrufe, ergo ist realloc der alleinige Schuldige für mein Performanceproblem auf Windows.
</p>

<p>
An dieser Stelle fiel mir ein, dass ich bereits an früherer Stelle einmal die gesamte Länge des Audio-Streams anhand der Metadaten geschätzt hatte. Durch eine somit vorgenommene Prä-Allokation des gesamten Speichers lässt sie die Laufzeit weiter auf 2.2 s drücken. Das ist immernoch nicht einmal halb so schnell wie auf OSX (0.9 s), aber das mag auch an der virtuellen Maschine liegen.
</p>

<p>
Mehr als diesen anecdotal Evidence kann ich nicht anbieten, aber ich bin mir sicher, dass ich ab jetzt die Finger von inkrementiellen Speichervergrößerungen auf MinGW/Windows lassen werde. Ist das in MSVC ähnlich schlimm, oder habe ich da etwa einen Bug entdeckt?

Seit einigen Wochen arbeite ich an einem kleinen Projekt: Eine Matlab-Funktion, die, ähnlich wie die standard-Funktion <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk_r13/help/techdoc/ref/wavread.html">wavread()</a>, Audiodateien einlesen kann. Aber nicht irgendwelche Audiofiles, sondern ALLE MÖGLICHEN Audiofiles. Wie geht das? Jeder kennt <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>, den Video-Player, der so ziemlich jedes Video öffnen kann, das man ihm vorsetzt, selbst wenn man überhaupt keine Codecs installiert hat. VLC basiert auf <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg">FFmpeg</a>, einem Open-Source Programm, welches Funktionen bereit stellt, um eben alle möglichen Mediendaten zu öffnen.
</p>

<p>
Und da FFmpeg freie Software ist, kann man sie auch für andere Dinge verwenden, etwa, um mit Matlab Audiodateien zu öffnen. Fehlt noch eine Verbindung zwischen Matlab und den FFmpeg-C-Bibliotheken, und die gibt es in Form von <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1605.html#intro">Mex</a>, der C-Schnittstelle von Matlab. Feine Sache, zwar hat es eine Weile gedauert, bis ich mich in libavformat und libavcodec eingearbeitet hatte (die beiden wichtigsten FFmpeg-Bibliotheken), aber im Endeffekt lief das alles sehr schmerzfrei &#x2013; und das, obwohl ich bisher Mex-Kompilieren mit Matlab immer als eine grausige Beschäftigung in Erinnerung hatte, gespickt von kryptischen Kompiler-Fehlern und hässlichen Notlösungen.
</p>

<p>
Bumms, Zack, kaum hatte ich mich versehen, hatte ich ein lauffähiges, tadellos funktionierendes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB#Calling_C_and_Fortran_functions">Mex-File</a> auf meinem Mac liegen. Damit hatte ich nicht gerechnet. Also sofort die momentane Euphorie ausnutzen und weiter zu Schritt 2, das Ganze nochmal auf Windows. Meine Probleme, Windows so einzurichten, dass ich endlich Kompilieren kann, <a href="http://www.daskrachen.com/2009/03/great-scott.html">hatte ich ja schon berichtet</a>. Ich hatte also Visual Studio 2005 installiert, um Matlab zufrieden zu stellen und einen anständigen Kompiler auf dem System zu haben. Aber war ja klar, MSVC macht wieder sein eigenes Ding und nichts ist mit Standardkonformität und Trallalla: Keine <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99#C99">C99</a>-Unterstützung, also keine Variablendeklarationen mitten im Code und keine stdint.h oder inttype.h. Ein Glück, es gibt wieder ein wenig mehr Free Software, die wenigstens <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/">letztere Lücke schließt</a>. Dennoch; Ich bekomme mein mex-File nicht zum Laufen. Es ist wie verflucht, kaum setze ich mich an eine Windows-Maschine zum Programmieren, fällt meine Produktivität auf das Niveau eines Backsteins.
</p>

<p>
Enter <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnumex">gnumex</a>, noch ein weiteres Stück FOSS, das es ermöglicht, GCC als Mex-Kompiler zu verwenden, AUF WINDOWS. Um die Dinge zu vereinfachen, verwendete ich die <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>-Variante und kaum war diese Hürde genommen&#x2026; lief alles. Einfach so. Wahrscheinlich bin ich ein Dickschädel und habe einfach nicht die Geistesschärfe, mit Windows-Kompilern zu arbeiten, aber mir scheint, alles was ich diesbezüglich anfasse und das nicht GCC heißt ist zum Scheitern verurteilt. Ein Glück, dass es die vielen klugen Jungen und Mädchen gibt, die so wunderbare freie Software schreiben, die mir das Leben so viel einfacher macht!
</p>

<p>
Eine Fortsetzung kommt noch&#x2026;

<p>
Mal wieder: Ich schreibe ein Stück Software für meinen Nebenjob bei meinem Signalverarbeitung-Prof. Diesmal geht es darum, beliebige Audio-Files in Matlab einlesen zu können. Perfekt geeignet ist dafür die selbe Bibliothek, die auch von VLC verwendet wird, libavcodec/libavformat. Das ist eine normale C-Bibliothek, es braucht also nur noch ein kleines mex-File, um ihre Funktionalität für Matlab zur Verfügung zu stellen. Klappt auch wunderbar. Auf dem Mac.
</p>

<p>
Schritt zwei ist dann, das Ganze auf Windows und Linux zum Laufen zu bringen. Eigentlich kein Problem, denn ich habe keine wilden Dinge getan und die Libraries selbst sind wunderbar Cross-Platform, es gibt sie sogar schon vorkompiliert für praktisch jedes denkbare Betriebssystem.
</p>

<p>
Also, was brauche ich? Zwei Dinge: Matlab und einen C-Compiler (der mitgelieferte LLC-Compiler macht mein Hirn bluten). Matlab zu installieren ist meiner Erfahrung nach schmerzhaft. Bigtime. Nicht, weil Matlab schwer zu installieren wäre, sondern, weil Mathworks nur zwei Installationen pro Schachtel erlaubt, was für meine drei Betriebssysteme zu gewissen Problemen führt. Außerdem müsste ich meine eine Lizenz erst für die Windows-installation umschreiben lassen, und&#x2026; ach, Schmerzen. Offenbar habe ich die Jungs dort aber schon derart häufig mit Lizenzanfragen genervt, dass sie mich einfach als hoffnungslos aufgegeben haben, denn dieses Mal musste ich keine neue Lizenz erstellen lassen, sondern einfach installieren, Passwort eingeben, und los. Mein Account meldet jetzt, dass ich fünf gleichzeitige Installationen hätte (von zwei erlaubten). Mir solls Recht sein.
</p>

<p>
Außerdem: ein aktuelles Linux muss her. VMWare sei Dank, lauert im Linux-Installieren nicht mehr der Schrecken, im Zweifelsfall den kompletten Festplatteninhalt zu verlieren, sondern nur noch, an akuter Progressbar-itis zu ersticken. War ja klar, dass Autoupdate sich diesen Nachmittag aussucht, um meine Ubuntu-VM hoffnungslos zu zerstören. Also, neues Ubuntu heruntergeladen, neu installiert, neu Updates aufgespielt, zwei Stunden Lifetime verloren. Immerhin: es hat fehlerfrei funktioniert, das ist was Neues. Matlab hinterher, VMWare Tools dazu, fertig ist die Development-Kiste. Jetzt fehlt nur noch eine Verbindung zu meinem Development-Verzeichnis, damit ich auf meine Dateien zugreifen kann. Fehlanzeige. Dukommsthiernichrein. Na Toll.

<p>
Also weiter zu Windows. Frühere Versuche ergaben bereits, dass ich Matlab nicht dazu bewegen kann, (a) GCC als Compiler zu nehmen oder (b) das bereits installierte Microsoft Visual Studio C++ .Net Professional Directors Cut Special Edition 2008 Ultimate zu verwenden. Nähere Nachforschungen zeigen: Zu neu, Kennternich. Geht nur bis MSVC Jahrgang 2005. Also: Neues MSVC deinstallieren, Altes installieren. ich freue mich immer darauf, MSVC zu deinstallieren, denn es besteht lediglich aus kompakten 12 Programmen, die sich zwar alle auf einem Haufen Installieren- jedoch nicht De-Installieren lassen. Immerhin ist es dank MSDNAA-Membership nicht schwer, an die alten Versionen heranzukommen. Und klar, die Systemsteuerung lässt einen auch immer nur ein Programm auf einmal deinstallieren. Multitasking ist nicht. Dank Syncplicity kann Windows die Zwischenzeit immerhin dazu verwenden, all meine Development-Files auf den Rechner zu laden. Yay!
Das Schöne an Fortschrittsbalken ist ja, sie zeigen Fortschritt. Damit haben sie einen klaren Vorteil gegenüber etwa Dachbalken oder den Bittewartenpunktpunktpunkt-Balken, die die Microsoft SQL Server 2008-Deinstallation stolz herumzeigt. Die fühlt sich wohl sehr wichtig, denn sie rödelt eine starke halbe Stunde im Bitte-Warten-Modus herum. So mag ich Deinstallationen.
