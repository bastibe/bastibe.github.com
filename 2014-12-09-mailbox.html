<p>
Why not just use Gmail<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>? Because if you're not paying for the service, you <i>are</i> the service. Google gives you Gmail for free, and in return they analyze and market your data. That's a fair deal, as far as I am concerned. But not a deal I want to make.
</p>

<p>
For one thing, I just don't like the idea of someone else reading through my email. Furthermore, I'd like my emails to be hosted in the same country I live in<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>, so that all the laws that protect the privacy of my letters are just as valid for my emails. So a German email provider it is.
</p>

<p>
First, I tried <a href="http://mail.de">mail.de</a>. They show ads, even if you pay them. Also, their web interface is surprisingly ugly. No thank you.
</p>

<p>
Then, I found <a href="http://posteo.de">posteo.de</a>, and they seemed to be doing everything right! Hosted in Germany, a buck a month, with a focus on security and privacy, and seemingly developed by friendly people. They even try to be environmentally friendly. In summary: perfect!
</p>

<p>
After half a year of using Posteo, though, I have found a few niggles. The web interface can't search mailboxes with a lot of emails&#x2013;I have an archive directory with 14k emails and the search wouldn't work. Their support says that's because there are too many messages in that directory. Also, they have had a bit too much down time for my taste: I experienced three outages of about two hours each in the last half year. Not a deal breaker, but it doesn't exactly instill confidence in their infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
Enter <a href="http://mailbox.org">mailbox.org</a>. Also German, also a buck a month, also friendly and safe and eco-conscious. But with a much nicer web interface, support for custom domains, and a working search box. They even support ActiveSync, which you'll like if you use Outlook or Windows Phone. In other words, Posteo done right. I'm sold.

Or <a href="http://outlook.com">outlook.com</a>, which is the same deal from Microsoft. Use this if you don't like Google's "priority" inbox and wonky IMAP support.

For the record, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/judge-mulls-contempt-charges-in-microsofts-e-mail-privacy-fight-with-us/">Microsoft</a> has made a point of having servers in each user's country and abiding by that country's law.
