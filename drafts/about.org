Hi, I'm Bastian, dad, hobby photographer, software developer, and
signal processing scientist in Germany.

Both photography and programming are about telling stories. Expressing
a complex algorithm in simple terms, or stunning vista in a compelling
picture. Finding order and simplicity in a chaotic scene or code base.
Therein lies the challenge and joy of life.

You can get in touch with me at *echtholz* at *mailbox* dot *org*.

** Education

*DOCTOR OF ENGINEERING*, Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg (2014-2021)

/“[[https://bastibe.github.io/Dissertation-Website/][Pitch of Voiced Speech in the Short‐Time Fourier Transform: Algorithms, Ground
Truths, and Evaluation Methods]]”/, Magna cum Laude \\

My doctoral work started with designing a pitch estimation algorithm
for voiced speech, but I soon realized that there already existed more
than enough algorithms. The real challenge of pitch estimation
therefore was finding good databases and visualizations and error
metrics for evaluating various algorithms. This lead to the
development of an audio-specific database, a custom batch processing
framework robust to scientific code running amok, and an interface
library for running Matlab code from Python, all released as Open
Source software.

*MASTER OF SCIENCE*, Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg (2012-2014) \\
*BACHELOR OF ENGINEERING*, University of Applied Sciences Oldenburg (2006-2010)

Two parts of /Hearing Technology and Audiology/, an engineering course
about all things audio across medicine, acoustics, electronics, and
signal processing. I put a major focus on Digital Signal Processing
and Psychoacoustics.

** Work

*FRAUNHOFER IDMT*, Oldenburg (2021-2023)

/Machine Learning Developer/ - C, Python, Kaldi

I inherited the core of an automatic speech recognition system, a DNN
engine and a WFST decoder. My job was to modernize this legacy code
into something maintainable and understandable, and port it to various
desktop, server, and embedded platforms.

---

*LECTURER*, University of Applied Sciences Oldenburg (2013-present)

/Introduction to Programming/, /Data and Algorithms/, /Applied
Programming/ and various lab classes and thesis supervisor

My lecture started as an advanced course on signal processing methods
in Matlab, but I evolved it quickly into a general advanced
programming course in Python, data analysis and GUI development.

---

*OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPER* (2014-present)

/Data Analysis, Audio, Image Processing/ - Python, C, Lua

The open internet has revolutionized the way we work with data. When I
started, there were not yet any good Python libraries for working with
audio data, so I had to write my own. [[https://python-soundfile.readthedocs.io][SoundFile]] and [[https://soundcard.readthedocs.io][SoundCard]] in
particular have almost a million downloads per month, and are included
in tens of thousands of other projects. Find a more complete list of
my contributions [[https://bastibe.de/projects.html][here]].

*SENNHEISER AUDIO LABS*, Waldshut-Tiengen (2012-2014)

/Signal Processing Engineer/ - Python, C++, Qt, QML

During my Master's studies, I worked part-time on simulating audio
algorithms and building a QML based GUI library for audio
applications.

---

*SOMIX AUDIO LABS*, Waldshut-Tiengen (2010-2012)

/Embedded Software Developer/ - C, C++, Lua, Blackfin, Qt, Python

We built the processing/software side of a mixing console for live
performances. My job was the user interface, including the GUI and
hundreds of buttons and dials and faders. I built a Lua scripting
system running on a Blackfin DSP, a bare-metal GUI library with a
graphical editor, a custom build system, and various audio effects
work.

---

*ALGORITHMIX* (2010)

/Freelance Mac Software Developer/ - Obj-C, C, OpenGL

I built a GUI Mac application around an existing audio analysis
library.
