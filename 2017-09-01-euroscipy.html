<p>
The second conference I attended this year was the <a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/2017/">EuroScipy 2017</a> in Erlangen. I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc8ru37dwf8">Talk about Audio in Python</a> and a <a href="https://youtu.be/qTgk2DUM6G0?t=10m15s">Lightning Talk about my Python/Matlab bridge</a>.
</p>

<p>
My most striking impression of EuroScipy is that every person I talked to was working on something interesting, and could talk about his/her topic clearly and with enthusiasm. This mirrors my feelings from last year's Chaos Communication Congress, where the short scientific section stood out for its clarity and passion. I also enjoyed the fact that attendees were international and diverse, and exuded a heart-warming sense of community.
</p>

<p>
Even though each scientific discipline has their own data sets, features, and models, everyone seemed to use a common set of methods (statistics, signal processing, machine learning) for working with that data. And, absolutely everybody used <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> for tutorials and teaching, and almost all data analyses were done in <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>. This is particularly heartening since these technologies are geared towards reproducible research and open data.
</p>

<p>
The hot topic of the conference clearly was machine learning and neural networks. However, the current confusion of competing frameworks and network architectures does not seem to be a good long-term solution. I hope that this ecosystem will eventually reach its NumPy moment, and collapse into a single, unified package. Then, neural networks might find their place as just another machine learning method with a few reusable parametrized prototype implementations in scikit-learn. Tools like <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> look like good steps towards this goal.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there was a lot of talk about “the reproducibility crisis” in science, and possible steps to improve the scientific process. In particular, I learned that it is absolutely necessary to not look at your test data before the final evaluation, to avoid overfitting your brain. You need to split your data into a development set for training, a validation set for parameter tuning, and a totally separate evaluation set for the final evaluation. In a similar way, it is important to state your hypotheses <i>in writing</i> before you test them, to avoid “HARKing” (Hypothesis After the Results are Known; aka “Noise Mining”, “P-Hacking”, or “Procedural Overfitting”). I dearly hope that <a href="https://cos.io/rr/">Registered Reports</a> will catch on, and absolve us from these all too human biases.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, EuroScipy 2017 was a ton of fun, and educational in many ways that I did not expect. If you are a scientific programmer, or if you maintain a scientific Python module, or if you are plain interested in scientific Python, I can highly recommend going to EuroScipy next year.
