<p>
Around this time of the year, I usually write a blog post about my
favorite books of the last year. But this time, not enough of them
really stood out. So instead, here's my favorite pieces of media I
consumed in the last year:

This is the story of how gunpowder changed the world. We get to see
the familiar history of central Europe, but told unusually, from the
bottom up: how seemingly small inventions change the course of peoples
and nations. The book is in essence a history of warfare in the last
few hundred years, but this time the movers and shakers are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">Great
Men</a>, but chemistry and engineering. A fascinating perspective, to say
the least.
</p>

<p>
Along the way, the book unraveled countless tangents and quirks I had
previously stumbled upon, yet never understood. How castles went from
tall walled structures to flat earthworks in the 18th century due to
the disruptive invention of cannons. How wooden galleons of 1850 were
obsoleted by turreted iron warships practically overnight. How rifling
and shells bled dry the coffers of Central Europe and made conflict
inevitable. This book contextualized many a story like this in the
most riveting manner!

Ever since we had our second child, I didn't really find the time for
video games any more, much to my regret. So when the Steam Deck was
announced, essentially a portable gaming computer, it didn't feel like
a worthwhile investment.
</p>

<p>
But boy, was I wrong about that. The genius of the Steam Deck is how
it's instantly-on, instantly-off like a video games console, allowing
me to play in short bursts that would not otherwise be available to
gaming. But in contrast to a console, the deck allows me to play games
without blocking the living room, and away from the computer screen
I'm working at all day anyway.
</p>

<p>
It has reignited my video gaming, and surprisingly not just for newer
titles, but thanks to <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/">EmuDeck</a>, emulated retro games as well. I had a
blast playing Banjo-Kazooie with my daughter, and Chorus, Ace Combat,
Guardians of the Galaxy and Death Stranding on my own. To me, this is
a revolutionary device, and I haven't touched my gaming PC or any of
my video game consoles since!
