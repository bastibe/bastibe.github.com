<p>
This semester is weird. Instead of holding my "Applied Programming" lecture as I normally would, live-coding in front of the students and narrating my foibles, this time it all had to be done online, thanks to the ongoing pandemic. Which meant I had to record videos. I have no idea how recording video works. This is a record of what I did, in case I have to do more of it. You can see the results of my efforts in my <a href="https://bastibe.de/2020-03-20-qt-for-python-tutorial.html">Qt for Python video tutorials</a> and my <a href="https://bastibe.de/2020-05-20-file-parsing-tutorial.html">file parsing with Python video tutorials</a>. Through some strange coincidences, wired.com wrote an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/anyones-celebrity-streamer-open-source-app/">article</a> about my use of OBS.
</p>

<p>
Working on Linux, I used the <a href="https://obsproject.com/">Open Broadcaster Software</a>, or OBS for short, as my recording program. OBS can do much more than record screencasts, but I only use it for two things: Recording a portion of my screen, and switching between different portions.
</p>

<img src="/static/2020-05/OBS_screenshot.png">

<p>
To this end, I divide my screen into four quadrants. The top left is OBS, for monitoring my recording and mic levels. The bottom left is a text editor with my speaker notes. The top right and bottom right are my two recording <i>scenes</i>, usually a terminal or browser in the top right, and a text editor in the bottom right. The screenshot shows the <i>Editor</i> scene, which has a filter applied to its source to record only the bottom right quadrant. On a 4K screen, each quadrant is exactly full HD.
</p>

<p>
In OBS's settings, I set hotkeys to switch scenes: I use F1 and F2 to select the <i>Browser</i> and <i>Editor</i> scenes, and F6 for starting and stopping recordings. To make these recordings look clean, I disable window shadows for the duration of the recording. For more compatible video files, I enable "Automatically remux to mp4" in OBS' advanced settings.
</p>

<p>
The second ingredient to my recording setup is KDE, where I assign F3 and F4 to activate the browser or editor window (right click any window → More Actions → Assign Window Shortcut). For example, to switch to the <i>Browser</i> scene, I hit F1 and F3, or F2 and F4 for the <i>Editor</i> scene. To make this work smoothly, I disabled these shortcuts within my terminal, browser, and text editor.
</p>

<p>
With that, I can record screen casts with very minimal effort. The last ingredient however is editing; and I loathe video editing. I'd much rather record a few more takes than spend the same time in a video editor. Instead, I record short snippets of a few minutes each, and simply concatenate them with <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>:
</p>

<p>
Create a file <i>concatenate.txt</i>, that lists all the files to be concatenated:
</p>

<pre class="example">
file part-one.mp4
file part-two.mp4
file part-three.mp4
</pre>

<p>
then run <code>ffmpeg -f concat -i concatenate.txt -c copy output.mp4</code> to concatenate them into a new file <code>output.mp4</code>.
</p>

<p>
The great thing about this method is that it uses the <code>copy</code> codec, which does not re-encode the file. I.e. it only takes a fraction of a second, and does not degrade quality.
</p>

<p>
In summary, this setup works very well for me. It is simple and efficient, and does not require any video editing. The ability to switch scenes is cool and powerful. But I don't know how often I accidentally recorded the wrong part of the screen and had to redo a recording. All in all, the 18 videos in the file parsing tutorials took 250 takes, according to my trash directory.
