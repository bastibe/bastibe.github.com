<p>
Sometimes, you just have to use C code. There's no way around it. C is the lingua franca and bedrock of our computational world. Even in Matlab, sometimes, you just have to call into a C library.
</p>

<p>
So, you grab your towel, you bite the bullet, you strap into your K&amp;R, and get down to it: You start writing a Mex file. And you curse, and you cry, because writing C is hard, and Mex doesn't exactly make it any better. But you know what? <i>There is a better way!</i>
</p>

<p>
Because, unbeknownst to many, Matlab includes a Foreign Function Interface. The technique was probably pioneered by <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/">Common Lisp</a>, and has since <a href="http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html">been</a> <a href="http://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html">widely</a> <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/functions.html">adopted</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">everywhere</a>: calling functions in a C library without writing any C code and without invoking a compiler!
</p>

<p>
Mind you, there remains a large and essential impedance mismatch between C's statically typed calling conventions and the vagaries of a dynamically typed language such as Matlab, and even the nicest FFI can't completely hide that fact. But anything is better than the abomination that is Mex.
</p>

<p>
So here goes, a very simple C library that adds two arrays:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C">// test.c:
#include test.h

void add_arrays(float *out, float* in, size_t length) {
    for (size_t n=0; n&lt;length; n++) {
        out[n] += in[n];
    }
}

// test.h:
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
void add_arrays(float *out, float *in, size_t length);
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Let's compile it! <code>gcc -shared -std=c99 -o test.so test.c</code> will do the trick.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's load that library into Matlab with <code>loadlibrary</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-octave">if not(libisloaded('test'))
    [notfound, warnings] = loadlibrary('test.so', 'test.h');
    assert(isempty(notfound), 'could not load test library')
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that <code>loadlibrary</code> can't parse many things you would commonly find in header files, so you will likely have to strip them down to the bare essentials. Additionally, <code>loadlibrary</code> doesn't throw errors if it can't load a library, so we always have to check the <code>notfound</code> output argument to see if the library was actually loaded successfully.
</p>

<p>
With that, we can call functions in that library using <code>calllib</code>. But we can't just pass in Matlab vectors, that would be too easy. We first have to convert them to something C can understand: Pointers
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-octave">vector1 = [1 2 3 4 5];
vector2 = [9 8 7 6 5];

vector1ptr = libpointer('singlePointer', vector1);
vector2ptr = libpointer('singlePointer', vector2);
</pre>
</div>

<p>
What is nice about this is that this automatically converts the vectors from <code>double</code> to <code>float</code>. What is less nice is that it uses its weird <code>singlePtr</code> notation instead of the more canonical <code>float*</code> that you would expect from a self-respecting C header.
</p>

<p>
Then, finally, let's call our function:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-octave">calllib('test', 'add_arrays', vector1ptr, vector2ptr, length(vector1));
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you see no errors, everything went smoothly, and you will now have changed the content of vector1ptr, which we can have a look at like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-octave">added_vectors = vector1ptr.Value;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that this didn't change the contents of <code>vector1</code>, only of the newly created pointer. So there will always be some memory overhead to this technique in comparison to Mex files. However, runtime overhead seems pretty fine:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-octave">timeit(@() calllib('test', 'add_arrays', vector1ptr, vector2ptr, length(vector1)))
%   ans = 1.9155e-05
timeit(@() the_same_thing_but_as_a_mex_file(single(vector1), single(vector2)))
%   ans = 4.6262e-05
timeit(@() the_same_thing_plus_argument_conversion(vector1, vector2))
%   ans = 1.2326e-04
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So as you can see, the <code>calllib</code> is plenty fast. However, if you add the Matlab code for converting the double arrays to pointers and extracting the summed data afterwards, the FFI is noticeably slower than a Mex file.
</p>

<p>
However, If I ask myself whether I would sacrifice 0.00007 seconds of computational overhead for hours of my life <i>not</i> spent with Mex, there really is no competition. I will choose Matlab's FFI over writing Mex files every time.
